expire
perish
die
stop living
stop breathing
leave the mortal coil
pass away
pass
slip away
succumb
be called home
enter eternal rest
depart
cross over
kick the bucket
assume room temperature
bite the big one
bite the farm
croak
depart this life
give up the ghost
go to a better place
go the way of all flesh
join the great majority
ride the pale horse
fade away
meet the grim reaper

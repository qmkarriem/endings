expired
perished
died
stopped living
stopped breathing
left the mortal coil
passed away
passed
slipped away
succumbed
was called home
entered eternal rest
departed
crossed over
kicked the bucket
assumed room temperature
bit the big one
bit the farm
croaked
departed this life
gave up the ghost
went to a better place
went the way of all flesh
joined the great majority
rode the pale horse
faded away
met the grim reaper
